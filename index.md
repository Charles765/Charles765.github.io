<br />
* **Three things I learnt today:**
<br />
  * Learnt about the public databases for retrieving genomic and proteomic sequences.
  * Learnt how to find the complement of a gene sequence and how to reverse it in order to transcribe it to RNA using Python programming.
  * Learnt how to use machine learning approaches to identify the handwriting style of digits and name what number they are.
<br />
* **Three things I did today:**
<br />
  * Getting an introduction to what bioinformatics involves and being introduced to my supervisors
  * Searching the different public online databases for genomic and proteomic sequences.
  * Downloaded anaconda and played around with the different packages.
<br />
* **Three questions:**
<br />
  * What are the machine learning approaches used to identify plants/diseases/cancers?
  * How can python be used for data visualisation and what packages are used for them?
  * How many complete genomes of organisms have been found?

<br />
* **Three things I learnt today:**
<br />
  * Learn how to use the public websites that are capable of multiple sequence alignments such as MAFFT and BLAST.

  * Learnt how to use Python to create sequence alignments.
<br />
* **Three things I did today:**
<br />
  * Went for a tour of the Monash Antibody Technologies Facility to observe the process of producing antibodies and immortal cells
  * Attended a presentation on how fluorescent proteins can be injected into organisms and be used to identify specific parts of a cell.
  * Discovered different public websites that can be used for multiple sequence analysis.
<br />
* **Three questions:**
<br />
  * How can python be used to create phylogenetic trees and analyse multiple sequence alignments?
  * What type of files and formats are used for multiple sequence analyses on python?
