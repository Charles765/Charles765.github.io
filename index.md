**Three things I learnt today:**
<br />
  * Learnt how to find the complement of a gene sequence and how to reverse it in order to transcribe it to RNA using Python programming;
  * Learnt how to use machine learning approaches to identify the handwriting style of digits and name what number they are.
**Three things I did today:**
<br />
  * Getting an introduction to what bioinformatics involves and being introduced to my supervisors
  * Searching the different public online databases for genomic and proteomic sequences.
  * Downloaded anaconda and played around with the different packages.
**Three questions:**
<br />
  * What are the machine learning approaches used to identify plants/diseases/cancers?
  * How can python be used for data visualization and what packages are used for them?
  * How many complete genomes of organisms have been found?
